# Todo List Application

## Description
A Todo List Application is a simple yet practical project where users can manage their tasks effectively. Users can create tasks, mark them as completed, update task details, and delete tasks as needed. Additionally, features like task categorization, priority levels, due dates, and reminders can be included to enhance the user experience.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow users to register, log in, and securely manage their tasks.
- **Task Management**: Enable users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Task Status**: Allow users to mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **Task Details**: Include fields for task title, description, due date, priority level, and category.
- **Task Sorting and Filtering**: Enable users to sort tasks by due date, priority, or category. Also, implement filtering options to view tasks based on status or category.
- **Data Persistence**: Store user tasks and preferences securely in a database for persistent storage.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (for RESTful API), MongoDB 
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user tasks and preferences

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Development Environment**: Install necessary tools and dependencies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, etc.
2. **Implement Backend Services**: Develop RESTful API endpoints using Express.js for user authentication, task management, and data persistence.
3. **Integrate Authentication**: Implement user authentication using JWT to secure API endpoints.
4. **Connect to Database**: Set up MongoDB database and integrate it with the backend to store user tasks and preferences.
5. **Test and Debug**: Test the application thoroughly, including user authentication, task creation/modification, and data retrieval.

## Additional Features (Optional)
- Collaborative Todo Lists: Allow users to share and collaborate on todo lists with friends or colleagues.
- Recurring Tasks: Enable users to create recurring tasks that automatically reset based on a predefined schedule.
- Time Tracking: Implement time tracking functionality to track the time spent on individual tasks.
- Task Attachments: Allow users to attach files or links to tasks for reference.
